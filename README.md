Docker container running [PlaneFinder's](https://planefinder.net/)'s `pfclient`. Designed to work in tandem with [sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf](https://github.com/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-readsb-protobuf). Builds and runs on `x86_64`, `386`, `arm64` and `arm32v7` (see below).

`pfclient` pulls ModeS/BEAST information from a host or container providing ModeS/BEAST data, and sends data to PlaneFinder.

For more information on what `pfclient` is, see here: <https://planefinder.net/sharing/client>.

## Supported tags and respective Dockerfiles

* `latest` (`master` branch, `Dockerfile`)
* Version and architecture specific tags available
* `development` (`dev` branch, `Dockerfile`, not recommended for production)

## Obtaining a PlaneFinder Share Code

First-time users should obtain a PlaneFinder Share Code.

In order to obtain a PlaneFinder Share Code, we will start a temporary container running `pfclient`, which will run through a configuration wizard and generate a share code.

To do this, run the command:

```shell
docker run \
    --rm \
    -it \
    --name pfclient_temp \
    --entrypoint pfclient \
    -p 30053:30053 \
    ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder:latest
```

Once the container has started, you should see a message such as:

```text
2020-04-11 06:45:25.823307 [-] We were unable to locate a configuration file and have entered configuration mode by default. Please visit: http://172.22.7.12:30053 to complete configuration.
```

At this point, open a web browser and go to <http://dockerhost:30053>. Replace `dockerhost` with the IP address of your host running Docker. You won't be able to use the URL given in the log output, as the IP address given will be the private IP of the docker container.

In your browser, go through the configuration wizard. When finished, you'll be given a PlaneFinder Share Code. Save this in safe place.

You can now kill the container by pressing `CTRL-C`.

If you're not a first time user and are migrating from another installation, you can retrieve your sharing key by logging into your planefinder.net account, and going to "Your Receivers".

## Up-and-Running with `docker run`

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name pfclient \
 -p 30053:30053 \
 -e TZ="YOURTIMEZONE" \
 -e BEASTHOST=YOURBEASTHOST \
 -e LAT=YOURLATITUDE \
 -e LONG=YOURLONGITUDE \
 -e SHARECODE=YOURSHARECODE \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder:latest
```

You should obviously replace `YOURBEASTHOST`, `YOURLATITUDE`, `YOURLONGITUDE` and `YOURSHARECODE` with appropriate values.

For example:

```shell
docker run \
 -d \
 --rm \
 --name pfclient \
 -p 30053:30053 \
 -e TZ="Australia/Perth" \
 -e BEASTHOST=readsb \
 -e LAT=-33.33333 \
 -e LONG=111.11111 \
 -e SHARECODE=zg84632abhf231 \
 ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder:latest
```

## Up-and-Running with Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '2.0'

services:
  pfclient:
    image: ghcr.io/sdr-enthusiasts/docker-planefinder:latest
    tty: true
    container_name: pfclient
    restart: always
    ports:
      - 30053:30053
    environment:
      - TZ=Australia/Perth
      - BEASTHOST=readsb
      - LAT=-33.33333
      - LONG=111.11111
      - SHARECODE=zg84632abhf231
```

## Claiming Your Receiver

Once your container is up and running, you should claim your receiver.

1. Go to <https://www.planefinder.net/>
2. Create an account and/or sign in
3. Go to "Account" > "Manage Receivers"
4. Click "Add receiver" and enter your share code when prompted

## Runtime Environment Variables

There are a series of available environment variables:

| Environment Variable | Purpose                         | Default |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------- | ------- |
| `BEASTHOST`          | Required. IP/Hostname of a Mode-S/BEAST provider (dump1090/readsb) | |
| `BEASTPORT`          | Optional. TCP port number of Mode-S/BEAST provider (dump1090/readsy) | 30005 |
| `SHARECODE`            | Required. PlaneFinder Share Code | |
| `LAT` | Required. Latitude of the antenna | |
| `LONG` | Required. Longitude of the antenna | |
| `TZ`                 | Optional. Your local timezone | GMT     |

## Ports

The following ports are used by this container:

* `30053` - `pfclient` web GUI. Suggest mapping this port for the web GUI.
* `30054` - `pfclient` "echo port". Suggest leaving this port unmapped.

## Logging

* All processes are logged to the container's stdout, and can be viewed with `docker logs [-f] container`.
